To copy a portion of an SDL_Texture in SDL3, use the SDL_RenderTexture function, 
passing the SDL_Renderer, the SDL_Texture, a SDL_FRect (or SDL_Rect) for the source 
rectangle, and a SDL_FRect (or SDL_Rect) for the destination rectangle. This function 
copies the specified rectangular portion from the source texture to the destination area 
on the current rendering target. 

C

#include <SDL3/SDL.h>

// Example usage within your game loop:
// Assume sdlRenderer and sdlTexture are valid SDL_Renderer and SDL_Texture pointers
// Assume srcRect defines the portion of the source texture to copy (e.g., for a sprite)
// Assume destRect defines the position and size on the screen where the copied portion will be drawn

// Example source and destination rectangles
SDL_FRect srcRect = {10.0f, 20.0f, 50.0f, 60.0f}; // x, y, width, height
SDL_FRect destRect = {100.0f, 150.0f, 50.0f, 60.0f}; // x, y, width, height

// Render the portion of the texture
unsigned short success = SDL_RenderTexture(
    sdlRenderer,
    sdlTexture,
    &srcRect,
    &destRect
);

if (!success) {
    // Handle rendering error
    SDL_Log("Error rendering texture portion: %s", SDL_GetError());
}

Explanation:

    SDL_Renderer *renderer: The SDL renderer you are using to draw.
    SDL_Texture *texture: The source texture you want to copy from.
    const SDL_FRect *srcrect: A pointer to the source rectangle defining the region within the texture to be copied. Use NULL to copy the entire texture.
    const SDL_FRect *destrect: A pointer to the destination rectangle on the rendering target where the copied portion will be drawn. 

Key Points:

    Floating-Point Precision:
    SDL3's SDL_RenderTexture function supports SDL_FRect for sub-pixel precision, which is useful for detailed scaling and positioning. 

Rendering Target:
The copying operation happens to the current rendering target. This is often the window's backbuffer, but could also be another texture set as a render target. 
Source Rectangle (srcrect):
This rectangle specifies the exact pixels to copy from the texture. 
Destination Rectangle (destrect):
This rectangle specifies where the copied pixels will be placed and scaled on the screen.
