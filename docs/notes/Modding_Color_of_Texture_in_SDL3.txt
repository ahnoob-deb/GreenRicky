To display textures in different colors in SDL3, use the SDL_SetTextureColorMod() function 
with a SDL_Color or SDL_FColor structure, or by directly setting RGB values to apply a 
color multiplier to the texture during rendering. For dynamic coloring, ensure your base 
texture is white or transparent, allowing the color mod to define the final color. 

Using SDL_SetTextureColorMod()
This is the recommended and most straightforward method in SDL3 to color-modulate a texture. 

    Set the Modulating Color: Before rendering the texture, 
    call SDL_SetTextureColorMod() with the texture you want to change 
    and the desired RGB color values.
    
        texture: The SDL_Texture you intend to color.
        r, g, b: The red, green, and blue color values, respectively, ranging from 0 to 255. 

C

    // Set the texture to red
    SDL_SetTextureColorMod(myTexture, 255, 0, 0);

    // Set the texture to blue
    SDL_SetTextureColorMod(myTexture, 0, 0, 255);

    Render the Texture: After setting the color mod, render the texture as you normally 
    would using SDL_RenderCopy() or SDL_RenderTexture(). 

Considerations for Base Texture Color

    White Base Texture:
    For best results, use an image texture that is white. This ensures that the color mod 
    effectively sets the desired color without being "washed out" by the original texture's 
    colors. 

Alpha Channel:
The SDL_SetTextureColorMod() function multiplies the color values and does not affect the alpha
 (transparency) channel. 

Resetting Color Mod:
If you have multiple objects using the same texture, you may need to reset the color mod to white (255, 255, 255) if the previous object had a different color mod set. 

C

// Example of resetting the color mod
void render_object(SDL_Renderer* renderer, SDL_Texture* texture, 
SDL_Rect dest, SDL_Color color) {
    SDL_SetTextureColorMod(texture, color.r, color.g, color.b);
    SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, texture, NULL, &dest);
    // Reset to white for other objects using the same texture
    SDL_SetTextureColorMod(texture, 255, 255, 255);
}

For Per-Pixel Coloring 

    For more complex scenarios where you need to set individual pixel colors rather 
    than a global tint, you'll need to work with the texture's pixel data. This 
    involves creating an SDL_Surface, locking it, modifying its pixel data directly, 
    and then creating a new texture from the modified surface.
